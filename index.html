                        <p class="lead">Mary’s Missions is a nonprofit charity working on behalf of the homeless, veterans and Native American women and children.  The missions began in 2016, with the efforts of one individual doing what she could for those less fortunate.  To expand the benefits to those three groups, Mary’s Missions applied for and received the 501(c)(3) ruling from the IRS effective Oct. 1, 2021.</p>
						<p> The fundamental work of that individual has been carried on and new elements have been added since that ruling was received. Originally, 24 backpacks each year were provided for the homeless, including winter scarves, mittens, hats, socks, hygiene items, rain poncho, notebook & pen, wash cloth and towel.  That work continues and a new project for the homeless was initiated – Summer Snack Bags, including bottled water, healthy snacks, sun screen and 2 $5 gift cards for McDonalds.  These were distributed in June, July and August.</p>
                        <p>The original project for veterans was 8 laundry baskets filled with a set of sheets and pillow case, pillow, shower curtain & rings, wash cloth and bath towel and Tide laundry pods.  A new project is in the works – a Kitchen Kit to help homeless vets transition to independent living.  These would include pans, cutting board, mixing bowls, knives, cookbook, etc., all packed in a 70 qt. tote with lid.</p>
                        <p>Efforts on behalf of Native American women and children began in 2020.  Boxes of clothing, educational materials and toys have been sent to Wild Horse Butte Community Development Center in Martin, SD on a regular basis, averaging 8 shipments per year, from 2 – 6 boxes each shipment.</p>
